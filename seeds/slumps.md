# Slumps

I feel slumpy today

I've felt slumpy these past few weeks

I've been going through these slumps more and more recently.

It's a feeling of incompetence, and also being overwhelmed with everything I have to do, need to do, want to do.

I try to achieve it away. I try to try harder. I try to get a bit more accomplished, but I still feel slumpy.

There are little things and big things that help, so let me advise myself once again


## Big things

Take time off, rest. Rest intentionally on the weekends. Practice physical, mental, and spiritual rest. Remember Sabbath is a gift.

Also take extended time off. I'm traveling at the end of the month, which can be a source of new stress. View it as a gift. View it as part of the process of being productive.

Talk to people. [[asking-for-help|Ask for Help]]. Share what you're feeling and get perspective from other people.


## Little things

Block Twitter. Just stop looking at it in the mornings, probably even the afternoons sometimes. Have a day in the week without Twitter. It's important to your job sometimes, but most of the time it's distracting, it encourages anxiety, and it encourages comparison.

Break up the big things into small things. Make tasks bitesized when they feel too large. Set a timer for 25 minutes when you're struggling to get started, and then just start.

Stop watching TV or YouTube during lunch. Go outside, go for a walk, read something, pet your dogs.

Celebrate the wins of each day. Acknowledge when you did something you wanted to.

Don't get caught up doing things that don't matter, or that you can do in the afternoon when you're feeling extra slump

## You'll make it through

Highs don't last and lows don't last. It's a cycle. If the slump keeps going, that's a problem, but it'll keep going if you don't do the big things and the small things you know will help.

So if you know it won't always be this way, don't despair, and don't try to achieve your way out.
