# Remix: The Good Parts

This post could go 1 of 2 ways. It could be:

1. What makes Remix good/unique compared to other frameworks

or 

2. What is the essence of Remix that is actually good

I'm not super interested in comparing to other frameworks. Mostly I don't feel like an authority on that. Additionally, I find the comparisons from the teams the most biased and thus least reliable in general.

So I think I'd prefer to focus on what are the good parts. Does that mean I need to mention the bad parts?

This is of course playing on the book "JavaScript: The Good Parts". From Perplexity, we get a nice breakdown of the key themes and topics:

1. Good Parts of JavaScript
2. Avoiding the Bad Parts
3. Coding Style and Best Practices
4. Prototypal Inheritance
5. Practical Tools and Techniques

The parts most relevant for a Remix version are:
1. Good Parts of Remix
2. Bad Parts of Remix
3. Coding Style? <- Hesitant to be too prescriptive here
4. Practical Tools and Techniques

I like the idea of talking about the good, which I think will point out what makes Remix unique. 

Things like:
- Built on Web Standards
- Data Flow
	- Forms
	- Progressive Enhancement
- Bring your own server

And the bad parts:
- File-based routing
- Classic Compiler
- Lack of static pre-rendering support
- Lack of RSC support

I'm being a bit leading, the point is that React Router v7 is going to have all the existing good parts, and fix the "bad parts".

I'm not super interested in being prescriptive about coding style, this stuff gets taken as gospel (look at the years of people following Redux boilerplate). Plus, other people have stronger opinions to opine here.

As far as practical tools and techniques, I'd probably just point to other libraries like remix-utils, remix-development-tools, epic stack
