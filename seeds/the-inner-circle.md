I don't anticipate writing much, just some impressions before I jump back into my day-to-day after a 10 day vacation.

This morning, while doing a few chores and stretches, I listened to an speech I'd had I've intended to hear for some months now: [The Inner Ring, by C. S. Lewis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9NpTcm8kxU).

This speech was "the Memorial Lecture at King’s College, University of London, in 1944." [^1]

If you happen to be reading this, I imagine the mention of C. S. Lewis may spark a visceral reaction in you. For some that of endearment, for others maybe that of hate, or at least the rolling of eyes.

Recently I watched the much-wanting Netflix adaptation of [The Three Body Problem](https://www.netflix.com/title/81024821) (the book is significantly better). In a later episode, two of the main characters are sharing a past memory in which one of the men was being hit on at a bar by a Christian. They two men laugh as they share the anecdote because he had mentioned to her that C. S. Lewis was not a very good writer (I believe he used the word "shitty") [^2]. I admit I have a great bias and love for Lewis, as one of the more recent Christian writers and thinkers who have helped draw me closer to God, rather than push me away. Be that as it is, and whether you like Lewis or not, he has a very provocative, or perhaps evocative way of communicating. Maybe to you it's "shitty", but I think his writing will nonetheless always provoke the reader to think more deeply.

^ Probably too tangental, likely will want to shorten a lot or remove.

I was provoked by the Inner Ring. I knew the concept of this speech: humans form inner rings, most people want to join the inner ring, beware of that desire and where it leads you.

I'd be surprised if most people don't understand what Lewis is referring to here. This is a human experience, nothing unique to Christians. The lure of it draws us all in, and we likely only need to think to our childhoods to remember negative examples where we were either excluded, or worst excluders.

For me, two memories come to mind.

When I was maybe 6 or so, my parent's church put on a "Parents Night Out". Essentially, free (or maybe low cost) mass-babysitting provided by volunteers of the church for parents to go enjoy a date night.

At this event, I knew a few other kids, particularly one a year older than me, whose brothers where all friends with my brothers. He had age and association to my brothers, 2 "inner rings" I longed for, so I stuck closely to him.

There was another kid, maybe my age, maybe slightly younger (these deltas make a big difference when you've only lived some 2000 days). He was playing some board game that required very rudimentary math, such as adding single digit numbers. My "friend" and I noted him using his fingers to count out the addition. I don't know who started the mocking, but I sure joined in, laughing at how childish it was to have to use your fingers to add together 3 and 4. I wanted to be "in", and more importantly I wanted someone else to be "out".

The boy cried and ran off, my friend put the guilt on me, and I felt the shame fully realizing what I'd done. I do believe I made up with the boy and we ended up playing another game together (arithmetical mocking-free). However, the exclusion and the guilt is the far stronger memory than the reconciliation. 

The other memory is of a time when I was excluded. I was attending a day camp when I was maybe 9, probably about to turn 10. The camp was sports themed (it took a while before I went to a STEM-based camp, where I fit in much better). I've never been particularly coordinated, and on top of it I rarely had good chances to play sports. Every experience was always with friends who were much better and enjoyed it much more, and I was there mostly to make the teams even (and sometime handicap the better team).

I was completely aware of my inaptitude. For some reason though, one of the kids at this camp felt it important to whisper about me to his friends when, I can only assume, he thought I wasn't looking. I pushed him to tell me what he was talking about, and I can't remember if it was him or another friend who revealed that the big "secret" was that I was the least athletic person in our entire "cabin" of 10 or so kids.

Taken one way, it was a fact, an easily observed one too. But deeper than that, it was a statement that I was "out" of the ring he and his friends were "in". it wasn't even really a ring I cared to be in, but my "out"ness being the source of some secret, some joke, made it hurt a lot more.

Again, you probably have your own stories from childhood where you were excluded or excluded. We can dismiss it with "kids are mean", and yeah, a lot of times they are. But it would be incredibly foolish to think this is an adolescent problem. In fact, it gets much worse in adulthood when unchecked, largely because like addicts we don't build a tolerance we build a dependence. On top of that, contrary to the lesson of the [Lord of the Flies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies), adults have the ability to accumulate and negatively use power and exclusionary practices on a scale unmatched by children.

This is what Lewis is warning about. It's important to note he's not advising we try to dismantle circles, in fact he argues that these inner rings are necessary, maybe even good. At the very least they are a part of life, and fighting their existence is the wrong course of action.

Stopping here for now. An outline for what's next:
- The rings in work
- My current desires to be in the inner circles
- Lewis advice
- How I've seen in practiced by those I admire

> You merely wanted to be “in.” And that is a pleasure that cannot last. As soon as your new associates have been staled to you by custom, you will be looking for another Ring. The rainbow’s end will still be ahead of you. The old ring will now be only the drab background for your endeavor to enter the new one.
