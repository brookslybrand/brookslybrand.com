# On Open-Source OR On Being Smart

I glorified the idea of working in open-source.

I was terrified of the idea of working in open-source.

I felt like I had to understand everything, how to package a library, all the intricacies of git and GitHub.

So many developers I looked up to were working on open-source projects. Because they were working on open-source, I looked up to them.

I could see what they were working on. How bold to share your code, how generous to give it for free. How much I wanted to be that.

But what did I have to contribute? Nothing. I didn't have good ideas for libraries. I could build websites and web apps, but I was the one reaching for a library, not building one.

I was a product engineer, building websites for clients. I loved learning new things, learning about the best new state-management library. I loved teaching others too. I wanted to make videos, I wanted to answer questions on StackExchange. I wanted to be relevant.

But I didn't have a blog. I didn't have an expensive camera or microphone. I always got beat when trying to answer a question on StackExchange, or I'd answer a question that would then be marked as a duplicate.

I had nothing to offer.

## Why glorify open-source?

[FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) is a philosophy, at least the way I've heard it used. And while Wikipedia tells me it's an umbrella encapsulating open-source software, I don't know if that paints the picture quite right.

Today lots of open-source has a patron behind it, typically a company. I have no opinion on if this is right or wrong, but even Michelangelo had patrons, (not that I would compare OSS to Michelangelo's contribution to humanity).

I bring it up to ask why we still glorify open-source, when most people who do it are just doing a job. They're working for a company, producing something the company needs. Why in my eyes was that so much better than an engineer building a framework or a component library behind closed doors.

My best guess is it's because I can't see behind those closed doors, and I can't glorify what I don't see.

It sounds simple, maybe even stupid when I put it that way. But I want to be known. I want people to think I'm smart. I see all these people share their code, code that says "I'm smart", and I wanted that.

And because I wanted to be smart, I never tried. Because trying would only show you one thing: I'm not very smart.

## Letting go

I was hitting a wall in 2021. Actually, I probably hit that wall in 2020, maybe even 2019. I loved the people I worked with, but I was not growing, I was not learning at the rate I used to be. I'd been working for the same company since 2015 (3 internships, 100s of hours of part-time work, and finally 3 years of full-time work).

I needed something else. I needed to work with people smarter than me. I needed to be in rooms where I was not smart.

It helped a lot. It was hard at first, but overtime it became okay to not be smart. It became okay to not know things. Because when I didn't now something, and I admitted I didn't, I learned something, and learning is the only hope I have for being smart.

But another thing happened. I started caring less whether or not I was smart. Maybe said better, I started caring less whether or not people thought I was smart.

I started caring a lot more about our users, about our product, about making sure [Texans could get groceries in their hands using our website](https://www.heb.com/). I learned by watching, and talking, and walking with senior engineers who viewed our job this way.

And then I started caring about other people. I cared that they cared about the technology they used, not as a status symbol, but as a tool. I cared about cultivating a culture of learning. I cared about making bridges between teams so they could learn from each other and discover they were about to do the same work twice. I learned about [being glue](https://noidea.dog/glue).

I started a [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/remix-austin/) during this time. I started caring a lot more about isolation, and loneliness, and the need to combat the "new normal" the pandemic required us to accept, but many found really hard to shake once societies doors could reopen.

I started seeing junior developers give their first tech talk, reminding me of the first time I gave a tech talk. I was glowing telling my wife how fun it was back in 2019, and now in 2022 I get to see someone just a few years behind me gain the same feeling.

I started caring about community, about all those bridges, and all that caring, and everything I was learning in closed-source and figuring out how to make it open-source.

## Open-Source, finally

Now I work in open source.

But I'm not one of the smart ones working on [the open-source framework](https://github.com/remix-run/remix), or at least that's how young-developer-me would see it.

I'm really happy about that. I'm really happy I'm not trying to show people I'm smart still. Well, I honestly still try to do that, but I'm a work in progress like all the people I now look up to are.

Now I get to provide [opportunities to contribute to open-source](https://remix.run/blog/oss-remix-dot-run) in a way that is more approachable to the product developers like I was.

I also get to help and encourage other [meetup organizers](https://www.meetup.com/pro/remix-run/) build local communities, and contribute to the culture of this open source project I work on.

I get to talk to people working on closed-source, and learn how our open-source is affecting them. I get to [fumble brand announcements](https://remix.run/blog/merging-remix-and-react-router) while trying to communicate and inspire good direction for swaths of developers.

I don't glorify open-source like I once did. Now that I'm here, open-source looks very little like I thought it did.

But I'm really happy to be working on open-source, and I wouldn't have wanted the path to get here to be any different.
